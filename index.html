<img id="bioimage" src="assets/images/Profile.jpg" alt="Thank You" width="250">

<p>My name is Bicen. This name is from the direct pronunciation of my Chinese name, although everytime when I first met someone, they always call me "Bison". By the way I like Bison too, I mean I like eating bison jerky. </p>

<p>I am originally from China and came to US for study. I graduated from Harvard 10 years ago from architecture major. I soon worked as architect after graduation, till now. I should have been proud of my experience in the field of architecture because I am always working for good firms and in good position. My previous job was in fortune 500 companies. I can't say I don't like architecture because it is always my interests. I really think coding is a skill that could help me thinking and improving my problem solving skill, although it is quite different with architecture.</p>

<p>As a designer, it's not surprise that I like to go to any interesting exhibition. My profile picture was from last year's yayoi kusama exhibition at the Borad Museum at downtown LA. By the way, the Borad is designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro studio, one of the famous architect. When I go travel I always visit the famous architecture project at the place I visit. In Seattle I visited the Seattle Library by OMA, in Chicago I visited the Robie House by Frank Wright. I also followed many fashion blog and like to read fashion and movie magazines.</p>
